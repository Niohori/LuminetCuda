# LuminetCpp
Cuda version of C++ version Luminet project.
Try to animate BH disk.
Work in progress. Do not use as a lot of  functionalities have to be implemented.
# Partial results :
Implemented Elliptic Integrals and function on GPU (both Toshio Fukushima algorithm as Carlson's ).

Moved to bmp rendering with glut instead of Dislin due to bad performance for image rendering.

Using reverse raytracing to speed up calculations.
